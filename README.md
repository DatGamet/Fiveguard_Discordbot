Hello, i made discord bot with slash commands to work with FiveGuard Ban / Unban / Baninfo / Kick / Offlineban functions
i added fivem server status too

config.json:
- Bot Token (token from discord.com/developers/applications) 
- FiveGuard resource name
- Permission Role ID (with this role, member can use ban and unban commands)
- Server Status (shows your current player count in the bot Activity)


You need to install npm modules using npm i command
if you need any help with the bot or you want to make a suggestion for the new bot, dm me :PeepoLove:
